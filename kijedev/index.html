        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p class="bio">Hello, I'm Adam Zobrist. I am a freelance developer with knowledge of HTML and CSS and a creative writer. I've completed several websites and stores and created this website to show them off. I also have a small collection of some of my creative works and other ideas that I’ve built out over the years.

            I want to earn a living creating stores and websites for earnest people and to grow my skills as a developer. I’d also like to write a novel and create games as a game developer, but my current skills lie in web development.

        <h2>Writing Fiction and Code</h2>
        <p>How did a fantasy writer majoring in English come to enjoy coding and web development? It really started while I was finishing an online college prep class. I took a course that taught Python as an introduction to coding, and from there learned HTML and CSS from an online boot camp. I like how structured coding is, which provides a break from the free-flow way I write my stories.

            Early in life, I never thought that I’d enjoy writing either. I wanted to be a ‘video game maker,’ but now my goal is more sophisticated. My new goal is to become a game designer, and not just for video games if I can. As you will see on this website, I have many ideas for stories and games that could be implemented in many different forms of media.
